Practice recursion in JavaScript

Take a look at the `test.js` file in each directory to see what needs to be implemented, write an `index.js` as the solution file.

Run all tests from the root: `npm test`
Run a single test from the directory: `npm test`
Run a single test in TDD mode from the directory: `npm run tdd`
